This is the exploration of great expectations.  I followed the tutorial listed [here](https://docs.greatexpectations.io/docs/tutorials/getting_started/tutorial_overview/) and also leveraged the handy work of [Gianna](https://github.com/GiaJordan): https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/blob/develop/schematic/models/GE_Helpers.py.
